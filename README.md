[Watch the Bees](http://admin:123456@kyserike.mynetgear.com:500/mjpeg/stream.cgi?chn=0)

## What Are my Expectations ?

My hope is to be able to gather data from my honey bee hives and use it as a tool to better understand the health and activity
of the honey bee colony. It doesn’t replace going in periodically and physically inspecting the hives, but used as a tool it
can help to gain an extra set of eyes to see what’s going on inside without physical disturbing the colony.

### How do I think I can use the data?

Weight
- Nectar Flow Indication and intensity.
- Winter Store Levels
- Foragers out and returning
- Swarming (Send Email / text alert / app notification)
- Robbing (Send Notification)

Hive Temperature
- Health of the colony
- Brood

Hive Humidity
- Indication of nectar 
- Indication of uncapped brood
- Indication of condensation issues (Winter)

Other Sensors
- Microphone (Noise Levels / Sound Analysis)
- Temperature Sensor / per box
- Lux Sensor (measure sunlight intensity)
- Camera / Video
- Motion Detection
