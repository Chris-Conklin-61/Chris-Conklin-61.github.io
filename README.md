[Watch the Bees](http://admin:123456@kyserike.mynetgear.com:500/mjpeg/stream.cgi?chn=0)

# Project Overview

Hone Bees play an essential role in our ecosystem. Our food depends on their pollination activity. A world without pollinators would be devastating for food production. A couple of years ago I decided to do my part to help the declining honey bee population by creating my own apiary. I also wanted to use my electrical and computer engineering skills to aid in understand my bee colonies.

Inspired by some work that a colluge had previously done and a couple of web resources dealing with monitoring activity within the hive using a variety of electrical sensors, I’ve used some of my electrical engineering and computer knowledge to come up withmy own Hive Monitoring system to better understand conditions within the hive without having to be physically at the apiary. 

The system monitors and records the weight of the hive, the ambient temperature and humidity at the hive location, and the
temperature and humidity within the hive. The readings are capture every minute and sent to “The Cloud” via a wifi connection
for display and analysis. Recently added to the system is a wifi camera. The complete Hive Monitoring system is also solar
powered so the battery health and solar production is also monitored.

## What Are my Expectations ?

My hope is to be able to gather data from my honey bee hives and use it as a tool to better understand the health and activity
of the honey bee colony. It doesn’t replace going in periodically and physically inspecting the hives, but used as a tool it
can help to gain an extra set of eyes to see what’s going on inside without physical disturbing the colony.

### How do I think I can use the data?

Weight
- Nectar Flow Indication and intensity.
- Winter Store Levels
- Foragers out and returning
- Swarming (Send Email / text alert / app notification)
- Robbing (Send Notification)

Hive Temperature
- Health of the colony
- Brood

Hive Humidity
- Indication of nectar 
- Indication of uncapped brood
- Indication of condensation issues (Winter)

Other Sensors
- Microphone (Noise Levels / Sound Analysis)
- Temperature Sensor / per box
- Lux Sensor (measure sunlight intensity)
- Camera / Video
- Motion Detection

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Chris-Conklin-61/Chris-Conklin-61.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Chris-Conklin-61/Chris-Conklin-61.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
